- both threads try to insert different keys (key1 , key2) that have the same hash
- thread1 starts the for loop and loads table[i] to e
- sometime before the thread1's call for insert finishes, the context is switched to thread 2
- thread2 starts the for loop and loads table[i] to e

- one of the threads update table[i] to the entry given by insert, thus inserting it's key
- the other thread updates table[i] to the entty given by insert,
  thus inserting it's own key and discarding the original thread key.
